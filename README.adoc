= mruby-lvgui

This is a WIP implementation of bindings for LVGL in mruby.

== Scope

This is currently intended for running simple short-lived GUIs in environments
that are not memory-constrained.

== Known issues

=== Incomplete bindings

Only the subset required for the intended use-case are written.

=== Leaks memory

There is no GC for LVGL objects.

This is not an issue for my intended use case, as it targets making simple
UIs that are shorter lived in an environment that is not memory-constrained.

Still, this should be fixed.

=== No memory management validation

This is a real issue, but due to the scope of the project it's not likely to
cause actual issues.

The main issue is that marshalling to and from the marshalled types in mruby
is not done right.

Then, the next issue is that it's entirely possible that *other* memory issues
exist, but since mruby values are preferred, it's less likely.

=== Hacks

Some hacks specific to the use-case are present in the bindings.
